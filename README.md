# Project: Predictive Models About Which Employees Are More Likely to Quit â€“ Machine Learning to analyze Employee Attrition

## Problem Statement 

As a Data Scientist at a multinational corporation, the HR team collected extensive data on their employees and approached you to reduce employee turnover and transform the human resource department by developing a model that could predict which employees are more likely to quit. Python programming language will be used to build the predictive model.

## Project description
1. Introduction:

    The Diamond Price Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model using the R programming language to estimate the price of diamonds based on various attributes. Diamonds are precious gemstones, and their prices can vary significantly based on characteristics such as carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and more. This project will leverage machine learning techniques to create an accurate price prediction model that can benefit both buyers and sellers in the diamond industry.

2. Objectives:

  - Build classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
  - Analyze and preprocess a dataset containing information on diamond attributes.
  - Implement feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
  - Evaluate and compare different machine learning algorithms for employee attrition.

3. Tools and Technologies:

 - Python programming language
 - Google Colab
 - Machine learning libraries in Pyhton (e.g., pandas , numpy)
 - Data visualization libraries (e.g., seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot)

4.Approach:
 - Data Collection and Preprocessing and Visualizations
 - Data Analysis and Model Comparison
   
5. Conclusion:

   - The Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and deep learning ANN  models were built to predict employee attrition.
   - Based on the accuracy of each model, the Logistic Regression model was the best fit.
   - The Logistic Regression model achieved 89.67% accuracy. Also, the Logistic Regression algorithm takes less computation time and is fast at classifying unknown records.
